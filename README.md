Cloud Init ISO
==============

Many premade cloud images (e.g. Fedora Cloud, Ubuntu Cloud) use some form of 
cloud-init to set instance/user metadata, such as hostnames and SSH keys. This 
works well when used in a cloud infrastructure such as EC2 or OpenStack that can 
seed this data, but not so well when used for local VMs, or an out-of-the-box 
XenServer installation.

However, [cloud-init supports an CD/ISO datasource][1], which can be loaded 
whether running the machine locally in KVM, VirtualBox, or on a XenServer host. 

This repository and guide aims to make this task a lot easier by pre-seeding a 
template and script. It draws heavily on existing resources ([2][2], [3][3]).

## Dependencies
You need one of xorriso, `mkisofs`, or `genisoimage` installed. 

For RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Oracle Linux, etc., `sudo dnf install xorriso`. For older versions, `sudo dnf install genisoimage` (use `yum` if on RHEL/CentOS/OL 7). For Ubuntu, Debian, and derivatives thereof, `sudo apt install xorriso`.

For macOS, `brew install xorriso`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository. (optional: maybe create and checkout your own branch?)
2. Modify the `meta-data` YAML file to specify your `instance-id` and `local-hostname`.
3. Modify the `user-data` YAML file -- according to [cloud-config syntax][4] -- to 
   specify a password and/or SSH keys. The cloud image determines the default user's 
   login name, but you can override that according to the [cloud-config documentation][4].
4. (optional) Commit your changes in git. This helps the build script name your ISO.
5. Build the ISO using `./build.sh`. You can either specify an output filename as the 
   first parameter (e.g. `./build.sh output-file.iso`), or you can let the script decide 
   on the filename. If you are working inside a git repository, the build script should 
   name your file after the branch and short commit hash, such as 
   `frost-init-20141228.dd648b2e.iso`.
6. If everything went well, attach the ISO file to your VM by methods 
   conventional to your virtualization hypervisor.
7. Boot the VM!
